  # Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike sharing data to understand the factors that influence demand. It explores the relationship between weather conditions, day of the week, and the number of bike rentals. The analysis uses data from the "Bike Sharing Dataset" containing daily and hourly rental information.

## Business Questions

The project aims to answer the following business questions:

1. How does the weather affect the number of bicycle renters?
2. Are bicycle usage trends different between weekdays and weekends?

## Data Wrangling

The data was loaded, assessed for quality, and cleaned to remove missing values and duplicates. The cleaned data was saved as `day_cleaned.csv` and `hour_cleaned.csv`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Weather Impact:** Visualizations and correlations were used to examine the relationship between weather conditions and bike rentals.
* **Weekday vs. Weekend:** Bike usage patterns were compared between weekdays and weekends to identify differences in demand.

## Visualization & Explanatory Analysis

Bar plots and correlation analysis were used to visualize and quantify the impact of weather and day of the week on bike rentals. The analysis revealed a significant influence of weather conditions and distinct usage patterns between weekdays and weekends.

## Advanced Analysis (Optional)

The project explored optional advanced analysis techniques:

* **RFM Analysis:** Analyzed user behavior based on Recency, Frequency, and Engagement to identify high-value users, churned users, and potential user segments.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Examined trends, seasonality, and potential anomalies in bike usage over time.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Visualized bike rental demand using location data, allowing for demand hotspot identification.  (This analysis depends on the availability of location data.)
* **Cohort Analysis:**  Analyzed user behavior patterns across different cohorts (groups of users acquired at specific time periods).  

## Conclusion

**Question 1: How does the weather affect the number of bicycle renters?**

Weather conditions significantly impact bike rental demand. Clear and pleasant weather leads to a substantial increase in rentals, while adverse conditions drastically reduce usage. Additionally, by analyzing time series data, we can identify seasonal variations in demand and potentially anticipate fluctuations based on weather forecasts.  

**Question 2: Are bicycle usage trends different between weekdays and weekends?**

Bicycle usage trends differ significantly between weekdays and weekends. Weekdays typically experience higher demand due to commuting and work-related purposes. Weekend usage patterns might reflect leisure activities or tourism.  Further analysis using RFM and cohort analysis can reveal distinct user segments and their specific behaviors, allowing for targeted marketing and service optimization.

## Insights and Recommendations

The analysis provides insights that can be used by bike-sharing businesses to:

* Optimize pricing strategies based on weather conditions and anticipated demand.
* Allocate resources effectively to meet fluctuating usage patterns.
* Target marketing efforts based on user segments and behaviors.
* Improve operational efficiency to enhance customer satisfaction.
